**- Function Expression:** A function can be assigned to a constant, making it reusable and preventing re-declaration.

**- Parameters:** Functions can take parameters, allowing them to be used with different values each time they are called.

**- Function Body:** The main operations of the function are enclosed in curly brackets, where the actual functionality is implemented.

These points are crucial for understanding how to create and use functions effectively in JavaScript.
