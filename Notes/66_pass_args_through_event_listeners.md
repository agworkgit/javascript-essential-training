# Summary

**- Accessing the Event Object:** When setting up an event listener, the event object is automatically passed to the callback function as an argument. You can capture and use it by naming it as a parameter in the callback function.

**- Passing Additional Arguments:** To pass additional arguments to the callback function, you can wrap the callback function in an anonymous function. This allows you to call the original function with the desired arguments.

**- Maintaining Context with `this`:** When using the `this` keyword inside the callback function, ensure you pass the necessary elements as arguments to maintain the correct context and avoid errors.

These points will help you effectively manage event listeners and pass arguments in your JavaScript code.
