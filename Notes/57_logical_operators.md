# Summary

**- Comparison Operators:** Logical operators are used in conditional statements to compare values and determine true or false outcomes.

**- AND and OR Operators:** The AND operator (`&&`) requires both conditions to be true, while the OR operator (`||`) requires at least one condition to be true.

**- Complex Conditions:** Logical operators allow for the creation of more complex conditional statements by combining multiple conditions.

These points are crucial for understanding how to use logical operators to control the flow of your JavaScript code.
