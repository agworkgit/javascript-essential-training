# Summary

**- Common Array Methods:** Methods like `slice` (sub-array), `splice` (delete), `split` (string to array), `join` (array to string), `push`, `unshift`, `shift`, and `pop` are used to manipulate arrays by adding, removing, or formatting items.

**- Advanced Array Manipulation:** Methods such as `forEach` and `find` allow for more advanced operations by applying functions to each item within the array or finding specific items based on criteria.

**- Practical Examples:** The video provides practical examples of how to use these methods, such as joining array items into a string, adding items to the beginning or end of an array, and looping through array items to perform actions.

These points help you understand how to effectively use array methods to manipulate and work with arrays in JavaScript.
