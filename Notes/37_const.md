# Summary

**- Block Scope:** Similar to `let`, the `const` statement defines a block-scoped variable, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in.

**- Immutability:** Once a `const` variable is assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned. Attempting to do so will result in an error.

**- Usage:** `const` is ideal for variables that should not be reassigned, such as objects, arrays, or functions. However, the properties of objects and the contents of arrays can still be modified.

This video highlights the importance of using `const` to ensure certain variables remain constant, leading to cleaner and more reliable code.
