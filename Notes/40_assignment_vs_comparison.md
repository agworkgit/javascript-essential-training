# Summary

Assignment (`=`): The single equal sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, let a `=` 5; assigns the value 5 to the variable a.

Comparison (`==` and `===`): The double equal sign (`==`) is used for loose comparison, checking if values are equal without considering their data type. The triple equal sign (`===`) is used for strict comparison, checking if values and their data types are exactly the same.

Example: 5 `==` '5' returns true because the values are the same, even though the types are different. 5 `===` '5' returns false because the types are different (number vs. string).
