# Summary

**- Basic Structure:** The `if...else` statement is used to execute code based on whether a condition is true or false. It is fundamental in controlling the flow of a program.

**- Boolean Values:** If the condition evaluates to true, the code within the if block runs; otherwise, the code within the else block runs.

**- Ternary Operator:** A shorthand version of the `if...else` statement, which can be used for simple conditional assignments.

These points are essential for understanding how to implement conditional logic in JavaScript.
