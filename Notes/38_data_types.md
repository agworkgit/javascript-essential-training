# Summary

**- Versatility of Variables:** JavaScript variables can hold various data types, including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, bigInt, booleans, null, undefined, objects, and arrays.

**- Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is a weakly typed language, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable. JavaScript will automatically identify the data type based on the assigned value.

**- Type Checking:** You can use the `typeof` operator to check the data type of a variable in JavaScript.

This video provides a comprehensive overview of the different data types you can work with in JavaScript and how to manage them effectively.
