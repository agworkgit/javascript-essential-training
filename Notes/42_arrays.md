**- Arrays in Programming:** Arrays are used to store, retrieve, and process data. They help group objects together and apply order to them.

**- Array Methods:** Methods like `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `splice`, `slice`, `flat` (flatten a nested array) and `unshift` are used to manipulate arrays by adding, removing, or repositioning items.

**- Visualizing Arrays:** Understanding array methods becomes easier when visualizing a physical array, helping to explain what each method does.
