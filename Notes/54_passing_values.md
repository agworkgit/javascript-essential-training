# Passing values between functions

**- Function Interaction:** Learn to create two interdependent functions where one function calls another, passing data between them to achieve a task.

**- Reusable Code:** By breaking down tasks into smaller functions, you can create reusable code, such as a function for image markup that can be used anywhere by passing the necessary arguments.

**- DOM Manipulation:** Practice using querySelector and the append method to dynamically add elements to the DOM, enhancing your understanding of how to manipulate web page content with JavaScript.

These points are essential for building efficient and reusable JavaScript code.
