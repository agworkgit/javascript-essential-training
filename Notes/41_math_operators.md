# Summary

**- Basic Arithmetic Operators:** JavaScript supports standard arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).

**- Advanced Operators:** The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division, and the exponentiation operator (\*\*) raises a number to the power of another number.

**- Increment/Decrement:** The ++ and -- operators are used to increase or decrease a number by one, respectively. They can be placed before or after the variable to control when the increment/decrement happens.

**- String and Number Addition:** When adding a number and a string, JavaScript concatenates them as strings. For example, 5 + '4' results in '54'.

These concepts are essential for performing mathematical operations in JavaScript.
