# Summary

**- Function Declarations:** Created using the function keyword, they are hoisted to the global scope and can be re-declared.

**- Function Expressions:** Involve assigning an anonymous function to a variable, often a const, and are not hoisted. This method is preferred in modern JavaScript frameworks.

**- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE):** These functions are executed immediately after they are created, useful for running code right away.

These concepts are essential for understanding how to effectively use functions in JavaScript programming.
