# Summary

**- Object-Oriented Programming:** JavaScript is a prototype-based object-oriented programming language, meaning it uses objects as the core building blocks.

**- Real-World Analogy:** Objects in JavaScript are similar to real-world objects, with properties (like color and size) and methods (like opening a zipper) that define their behavior and characteristics.

**- Prototypes and Instances:** Each object is an instance of an object prototype, sharing common properties while maintaining unique values for those properties.

These points help you understand the foundational concepts of objects in JavaScript.
