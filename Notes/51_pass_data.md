# Summary

**- Function Parameters and Arguments:** Functions can take parameters, which are placeholders for the values (arguments) passed to the function when it is called.

**- Dynamic Functionality:** By using parameters, functions can perform operations on different values each time they are called, making them more flexible and reusable.

**- Example Implementation:** The video demonstrates how to create a tip calculation function that takes a sum, percentage, and currency symbol as parameters, allowing for dynamic tip calculations based on user input.

These points are essential for understanding how to make your functions more versatile and useful in JavaScript.
