# Summary

**- Simplified Syntax:** Arrow functions provide a shorter way to write function expressions using the `=>` syntax.

**- No Hoisting:** Unlike traditional functions, arrow functions are not hoisted and must be declared before they are used.

**- Context and Scope:** Arrow functions do not have their own this context, making them useful for maintaining the context of the surrounding code.

These points highlight the main advantages and differences of using arrow functions in JavaScript.
