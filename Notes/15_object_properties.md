# Summary

**- Definition:** Object properties describe different aspects of an object using a name-value pair.

**- Property Names:** Names can include letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores. Avoid using quotation marks, hyphens, or other symbols.

**- Value Types:** Values can be strings, integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, arrays, or even other objects.

**- Naming Convention:** Use camel case (e.g camelCase) for property names to ensure proper functionality and avoid errors.

These points will help you define and manage object properties effectively in JavaScript.
