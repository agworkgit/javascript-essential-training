# Summary

**- Block Scope:** The `let` statement defines a block-scoped local variable, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in, such as within a function or a loop.

**- Avoiding Scope Issues:** Using `let` helps avoid variable scope issues that can arise with `var`, as `let` variables are confined to their local scope.

**- Local vs. Global Scope:** You can have variables with the same name in different scopes (local and global) without conflict, as `let` ensures they are treated separately.

**- Error Handling:** If you try to access a `let` variable outside its scope, JavaScript will throw an error, making it easier to identify and fix scope-related issues.

This video emphasizes the importance of using `let` for better control and predictability in your code.
