# Summary

**- Event Listener Structure:** An event listener is a method added to a target (usually an element) that listens for a specific event and calls a function when that event is detected.

**- Adding Event Listeners:** Use the `addEventListener` method with two main arguments: the event to listen for (e.g., `"click"`) and the callback function to run when the event is triggered.

**- Practical Example:** The video demonstrates how to append an event listener to a button that changes the text from "open" to "closed" and back when clicked.

These points highlight how to set up and use event listeners to make web pages interactive.
