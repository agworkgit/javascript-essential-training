# Summary

**- Declaring Variables:** Use the `var` statement to declare a variable and assign it a value using the equal sign (`=`). For example, `var container = 5;`.

**- Mutable Nature:** Variables declared with var can have their values changed at any time. For instance, container can be reassigned from `5` to `"red"`.

**- Multiple Declarations:** You can declare multiple variables in one statement using a comma-separated list, like `var x = 4, y = 5, z = "blue";`.

**- Undefined Variables:** Variables can be declared without an initial value, resulting in an `undefined` state until a value is assigned.
