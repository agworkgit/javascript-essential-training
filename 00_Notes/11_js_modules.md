# Here are the key takeaways from the "JavaScript modules" video:

**- Modularisation:** JavaScript modules allow you to break down large scripts into smaller, manageable files, which can then be imported and used in other files.

**- Import and Export:** Use export to make variables, functions, or objects available for other files, and import to bring them into your main script.

**- Scope Management:** Modules help manage scope by keeping variables and functions local to their files, reducing the risk of conflicts and making code easier to maintain.

These points will help you understand how to organize and structure your JavaScript code more effectively.
