# In the "JavaScript language basics" video, here are the key takeaways:

**- Top-to-Bottom Writing:** Write your JavaScript code from top to bottom, defining variables, functions, and objects before using them to avoid issues.

**- Comments:** Use comments (single-line with // and multi-line with /\* \*/) to explain your code for yourself and others. They are ignored by the browser.

**- Spacing and White Space:** Spacing is for readability; the browser ignores it. Use indentation to show hierarchy in your code.

**- Semicolons and Quotation Marks:** Adding semicolons at the end of statements and using consistent quotation marks (single or double) are developer preferences. Tools like ESLint and Prettier can enforce these standards.

These points will help you write clean and maintainable JavaScript code.
