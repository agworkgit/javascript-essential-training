# Here are the key takeaways from the video "Tools for working with JavaScript":

**- Modern Browser:** Install a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. Chrome is used throughout the course.

**- Code Editor:** Use a code editor that highlights your code. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is recommended and is free to download.

**- Live Server Environment:** Ensure your code editor has a live server extension, like the "Live Server" extension in VS Code, to simulate a web server environment on your computer.

**- Browser Console:** Learn how to access the browser console (e.g., by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" in Chrome) to interact with JavaScript directly.

These tools will help you work efficiently with JavaScript and ensure your code behaves as expected.
