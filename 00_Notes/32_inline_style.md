# Summary

**- Accessing Inline Styles:** Inline styles of an element can be accessed and modified using the `style` property.

**- Setting Properties:** Individual CSS properties can be set directly using dot notation (e.g., `element.style.color = "purple"`).

**- CSS Text Property:** The CSS text property can be used to set multiple styles at once, but it's recommended to modify individual properties for better control.

These points highlight how to effectively manage and manipulate inline styles using JavaScript.
