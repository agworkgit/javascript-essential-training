# Summary

**- Defining Objects:** JavaScript objects are collections of data and functionality, stored as properties and methods. They are defined using curly brackets {} and can contain various data types.

**- Properties and Methods:** Properties are name-value pairs that describe the object, while methods are functions that can manipulate these properties.

**- The `this` Keyword:** The `this` keyword refers to the _current_ object, allowing methods to interact with the object's properties.

These points will help you understand how to create and work with JavaScript objects effectively.
