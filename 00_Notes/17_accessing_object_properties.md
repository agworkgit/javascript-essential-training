# Here are the key takeaways from the "Accessing object properties" video:

**- Dot Notation:** Preferred for accessing object properties due to its readability and simplicity. Example: `object.property`.

**- Bracket Notation:** Useful when property names are dynamic or non-standard. Example: `object["property"]`.

**- Use Cases:** Dot notation is ideal for standard property names, while bracket notation is necessary for properties with special characters or when using variables as property names.

These points will help you effectively access and manipulate object properties in JavaScript.
