# Summary

**- Inline and External JavaScript:** JavaScript can be included directly within an HTML document using the `<script>` tag or as an external file.

**- Placement of Script Tags:** While script tags can be placed anywhere in the document, placing them at the end of the body is common to ensure the HTML content is fully rendered before the JavaScript executes.

**- Rendering Process:** The browser reads and renders HTML from top to bottom. When it encounters JavaScript, it pauses rendering to execute the script, which is why script placement is crucial for proper functionality.

These points will help you understand how to effectively include and position JavaScript in your HTML documents.
