# Summary

**- Older Methods:** The video discusses two older methods for accessing elements in the DOM: `getElementsByClassName` and `getElementById`.

**- Usage:** `getElementsByClassName` returns an array-like object of all child elements matching the class name, while `getElementById` returns a single element with the specified ID.

**- Comparison:** These methods are still functional but are less favored compared to querySelector and querySelectorAll, which offer more flexibility and simplicity.

These points highlight the transition from older methods to more modern and efficient ways of accessing DOM elements.
