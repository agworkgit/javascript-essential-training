# Here are the key takeaways from the "Object containers" video:

**- Constant Variables:** Objects in JavaScript are often stored in constant variables using the `const` keyword, which means the object itself can't be reassigned, but its properties can be changed.

**- Object Assignment:** Attempting to reassign a new value to a constant object variable will result in an error, ensuring the object itself remains intact.

**- Modifying Properties:** While you can't reassign the object, you can modify its properties. For example, changing the volume property of a backpack object from 30 to 50 is allowed.

These points will help you understand how to manage and manipulate objects effectively in JavaScript.
