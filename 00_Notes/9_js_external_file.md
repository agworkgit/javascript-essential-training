# Summary

**- External JavaScript Files:** It's best practice to place JavaScript in separate files when you have a lot of script or need to apply it to multiple documents.

**- Referencing External Files:** Use the `<script>` tag with the src attribute to link to your external JavaScript file within your HTML document.

**- Script Placement:** Place the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the HTML body to ensure the HTML content is fully loaded before the JavaScript runs, preventing errors related to accessing elements that haven't been rendered yet.

These points will help you manage and organize your JavaScript code more effectively.
